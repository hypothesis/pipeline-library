**Obsolete: In September 2022, Hypothesis application deployments were migrated from Jenkins to GitHub Actions. Hence this library is no longer used.**

pipeline library
================

This repository contains procedures used by [Jenkins
Pipeline](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/) configuration files (i.e.
`Jenkinsfile`s) in multiple projects at Hypothesis.

Jenkins Pipeline's [shared library
support](https://jenkins.io/doc/book/pipeline/shared-libraries/) allows us to
define and evolve a set of shared pipeline helpers in this repository, and
provides a straightforward way of using those functions in a `Jenkinsfile`.

How do I use the helpers defined here?
--------------------------------------

To use the helpers defined in this repository, you must include a `@Library`
declaration at the top of your `Jenkinsfile`:

```groovy
@Library('pipeline-library') _
```

This tells the Pipeline executor to use the default version of the library (the
master branch in this repository). You can also pin to a branch, tag, or commit
using an `@version` identifier. For example, to use the `devel` branch:

```groovy
@Library('pipeline-library@devel') _
```

Include the underscore at the end of the line in order to avoid being caught out
when pinning to versions of the library other than the default.

**N.B.** Currently, this library is configured globally in our Jenkins instance
(at `Manage Jenkins → Configure System → Global Pipeline Libraries`). Ideally,
we would use the support for fully-namespaced library definitions such as
`@Library('github.com/hypothesis/pipeline-library')` but there is currently no
way to execute functions from such libraries "unsandboxed," so they are very
limited in their usefulness.

How can I add new shared functions?
-----------------------------------

Global variables and functions (those exposed within dependent `Jenkinsfile`s at
the top scope) are defined in the `vars/` directory, one per file. A "hello
world" example function can be found in `vars/sayHello.groovy`, and would be
used in a `Jenkinsfile` like this:

```groovy
@Library('pipeline-library') _

stage('hello') {
    sayHello('Francesca')
}
```
